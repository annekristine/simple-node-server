document.getElementById('content1').innerHTML = "This is a program or a software system which is designed to search information on the World Wide Web. Information searched may be web pages, websites, pictures, videos and other files.  Search engines work by using a web crawler like GoogleBot to fetch these documents. To know which documents to get, an indexer reads them and creates an index based on the words these files contain. This is done so that results from search engines will only show sites or pages that are relevant. Since there is a very large amount of webpages present and a large percentage of them depend on search engines, the idea of optimizing and putting up interesting, updated and relevant content was necessary to improve a websiteâ€™s ranking on the search engine results";
document.getElementById('content2').innerHTML = "When you use search engines to look for answers, you are not searching the web, as most people know. Instead, you are searching the stack of information that the search engine has, you are searching through the index that the search engine created. ";
document.getElementById('content3').innerHTML = "To rank the webpages, search engines conduct indexing, where they collect and stores data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. Without indices, search engines would need more time and work before they could give results. Currently, indexing is done using algorithms which is different from every search engine. The algorithm they used will determine the relevance of information in the index.";
document.getElementById('content4').innerHTML = "Most, if not all of the search engines use algorithm indexing since it is more efficient and fast compared to humans operating it. In human powered search engines, they rely on humans to conduct indexing and cataloguing of information. Only the information that they submitted will be placed in the index. Commonly, those that uses human editors to create and build their indices are called web directories.";
