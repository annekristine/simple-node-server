        <em>Top 3 Feeling ko Favourite ko Movies (Not Ranked)</em> <br><br>
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082406/"> The Fox and the Hound </a> <p>When I first watched this movie as a kid, I wasn't able to finish it because I cried after that <strong>one fudging tear-jerker scene.</strong>
        where the grandmother bid farewell and left the fox. I think it was the first movie that made me cry aside from Titanic (don't judge, I was a kid). Thinking that the rest of the mpvie will make me cry more, I didn't
        dare to even watch the rest of the movie.</p>
        <br> <br>
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/">Pride and Prejudice</a><br> <p>Who didn't fell in love with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship? Certainly not me and my roommate. Considering that I'm such a hopeless 
        romantic person (sorry not sorry), this movie is perf. </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls058618300/">Jurassic Park Series</a><br><p>Since I can't pick a movie from the Jurassic Park Series, I'll pick them all. Following this franchise and watching other cartoons that feature 
        dinosaurs since I was a kid, I can't help but watch it over and over and over and over and I don't even get tired of these creatures and people getting eaten by them.</p>

        <em>Top 3 Feeling ko Favourite ko Songs (Not Ranked)</em><br><br>
        <a href ="https://youtu.be/5anLPw0Efmo">My Immortal</a><br><p>This was one of my favourite song when I was in grade school not because it was back in the emo days but because it is one of <strong>THE</strong></em> otp songs</p>
        <a href= "https://youtu.be/BsYE078RQCI">Settle Down</a><br><p>The 1975 songs are really quite unique since for me, it is like a clash of the old songs (70s-80s) and the modern pop. The song is really catchy and is "dance-able" 
        (in the shower if you're shy)</p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/kT1t4jVmv7E">Bohemian Rhapsody</a><br><p>For me, this song is so weird but so great since it is like a compilation of different songs in 1 song. I don't even know how they composed this but Panic! at the Disco's
        version is sexy huehue
